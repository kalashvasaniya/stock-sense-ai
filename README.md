# StockSenseAI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, first, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

## 🔑 Set Up OpenAI API Key

To connect with OpenAI, you'll need to add your OpenAI API key to the project:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following line to the file, replacing `your-openai-key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
    ```

This will enable the application to authenticate and communicate with OpenAI services.

## ✏️ Start Editing

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page will automatically update as you save your changes.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load **Geist**, a modern font family from Vercel.
